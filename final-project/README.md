## Idea 1
![Alt text](<Images/IMG_0457 2.jpg>)

The idea was to create a personal website to showcase my experiences, skills, and projects. It will be an interactive portfolio that presents my work in a clean and intuitive vertical scroll format. 

Design: The page starts with a bio and my image, then moves on to my experiences. Lastly, the projects will be displayed as a stack of cards. The users can click to enter the specific project page.

Motivation: This portfolio aims to provide potential employers or collaborators with a quick, accessible way to understand my experience and skillsets. The simplicity of a vertical scroll format allows visitors to explore my work intuitively and without distractions.

Interactivity and Engagement: To make the design engaging, I plan to use subtle animations and transitions to guide the user’s attention. For instance, when scrolling, project descriptions and visuals will smoothly animate into view. I also plan to use many hover effects. The library I will look into for this idea are GSAP and Motion One. 

Accessibility: I will ensure accessibility by adhering to WCAG guidelines, focusing on contrast and readable font sizes. 

Information to Convey: The website will include a biography, my experiences, my design projects, contact information.

Design Concerns:
How can I add engaging interactivity to a basic personal website?

## Idea 2

This portfolio will showcase my design work in a horizontal scrolling format, simulating a digital gallery experience.

Motivation: The motivation behind this design is to create a unique, immersive browsing experience that sets my portfolio apart from typical vertical scroll websites. This layout better showcases visual-heavy projects and invites the user to explore the portfolio as they would in a real-world gallery.

Interactivity and Engagement: To enhance interactivity, the site will feature parallax scrolling, where background elements move at different speeds, creating depth. Projects will be represented as "cards," with each card expanding to full-screen mode upon click to reveal more details and interactive content. I will also add hover effects and smooth transitions.

Accessibility: I’ll make this design accessible by providing signals on how to scroll. I need to consider how to make this compatible on mobile experience. 

Information to Convey: This portfolio will include an introductory section about me, followed by a gallery of design projects. 

Design Concerns:
- How can I ensure that users understand the horizontal scroll mechanic intuitively?
- How can I optimize the horizontal scrolling mechanism for both desktop and mobile users, ensuring a smooth experience across devices and screen sizes?

## Idea 3
![Alt text](Images/IMG_0458.jpg)

Basic Idea: FigmaStart is an interactive tool designed to teach beginners how to use some key features of Figma. 

Motivation: The motivation behind this tool is to create a more practical and engaging learning experience compared to Figma’s official resources, which can feel overwhelming for beginners.

Interactivity and Engagement: The tool will feature many animations that use GSAP and Motion One.

Accessibility: I will ensure accessibility by adhering to WCAG guidelines, focusing on contrast and readable font sizes. 

Information to Convey: FigmaStart will focus on teaching the core features of Figma, targeting beginners. 

Design Concerns: 
- How can I present key information in a clearer and more interactive way than Figma official resources page?
- How should I integrate visual aids, animations, or interactive elements to help users retain information effectively?

## Critiques Received
During the lab session, several important critiques were raised that will help refine the direction of my project. A key point was to consider the scope of my project and whether it is feasible given the limited time frame. I leanred that there is the need to define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It was suggested that I prioritize necessary features over “nice to have” features to ensure I accomplish a fully functional and polished outcome within the deadline.

Accessibility was another major theme. I was reminded to ensure my designs are accessible to a wide audience, paying attention to design elements such as color contrast, readability, and support for screen readers or keyboard navigation. 
I also received feedback on adding clear signifiers for the scrolling mechanism (especially horizontal scrolling), in order to ensure users intuitively understand how to navigate the site without confusion.

One suggestion was to check out Camille Mormal’s website as a reference for horizontally scrolling website. 

Regarding the portfolio structure, there was feedback around determining whether my projects should be placed in a horizontal or vertical scroll format depending on their content. Some projects might naturally lend themselves to one format over the other based on their visual and narrative flow.

Another feedback was to clarify whether my FigmaStart tool should target beginners or advanced users. This is crucial, as it will dictate the complexity of features I plan to include in the tool. Defining the target audience clearly will also help the users in understanding this website.

Finally, I received more creative ideas, such as placing projects in an infinite space where users could navigate in any direction, not only just horizontally or just vertically. 

## Reflection
Based on the feedback I received during the lab session, I’ve decided to move forward with the first idea: a personal website in a vertical scroll format. This idea is not only something I’m passionate about, but it also has an approachable scope that I can realistically complete in the two-month timeframe. Additionally, the general consensus from the feedback was that this option works best in terms of clarity and usability.

One critique I will act on is the suggestion to focus on creating a MVP. By narrowing down my priorities to the essential features, I can ensure that the website is functional by the deadline. For the next step, I will plan out the MVP I want my basic website to have. 

I will also incorporate the feedback around accessibility and affordance/signifiers for the scrolling mechanism. Since this design follows a simple vertical scroll, I will need to make sure it is not too basic by adding interactive elements that guide the user without overwhelming them. To address accessibility, I will ensure proper contrast, readable fonts, and make the site easily navigable with a keyboard or screen reader. 

However, I will not pursue more complex ideas like the infinite space navigation or horizontal scrolling at this stage. While these ideas are creative and intriguing, they are not really in the approachable scope I want to maintain for this project. Additionally, I think that a vertical scroll is more suitable for presenting my projects clearly and effectively for future usages.

Finally, I will make decisions about the content I want to include, focusing on key projects that best showcase my design process and skills, and avoid overloading the portfolio with excessive details.
